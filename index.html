<H2>Objective</H2>
<L1>Looking for an engineer position in modeling, control and/or simulation. 
    Over 7 years of experience in modeling (including system modeling and numerical modeling), 
    specialized in the area of thermal power and chemical process. </L1>

<H2>Experience</H2>
<H3>EEDP Engineer, General Electric, Shanghai, China, 2016 - 2017</H3>
<LI>Conducted complicated system model for 600MW thermal power plant, including multi-physics subsystems for boilers, heat exchangers, steam turbines and auxiliary devices, and simulate the physics of fluid, thermal, mechanical and controls.</LI>
<LI>Help to design thermal storage integration with traditional thermal power plant and and utilized model and controls to 
    quantitatively measure the improvement of plant flexibility.  </LI>

<H3>Research Engineer(contractor), ALSTOM Power, Windsor, CT, 2015 - 2016</H3>
<LI>Analyzed large dataset of historical thermal plant (thermodynamic data/min throughout a year), selected appropriate data sets to train & validate model(APROS) and improved the model accuracy. </LI>
<LI>Proposed and scripted parameter automatic tuning in MATLAB to substitute original manual tuning that the efficiency of model validation is greatly increased (60% saving in labor).  </LI>
<LI>Developed and maintained in-house models, ran virtual tests for design, manufacturing engineers, analyzed potential engineering risks/concern and proposed solutions for the engineering department. </LI>

<H3>Research Assistant, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, 2009 - 2014</H3>
<LI>Designed the novel chemical processes to solve solar energy intermittency problem. Verified the design with mathematic models, including 1D dynamic model in MATLAB and 2D simulation(Finite Element Method) in COMSOL.</LI>
<LI>Proposed mass and heat transfer model for two-phase flow (water/steam) in solar receiver piping system. Optimized the design of solar collector to achieve minimal electricity cost(LCOE).</LI>
